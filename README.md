# OpenWhisk User Events

This service connects to `events` topic and publishes the events to various services like Prometheus, Datadog etc via 
Kamon. Refer to [user specific metrics][1] on how to enable them

## Build

This command pulls the docker images for local testing and development.

```bash
make docker-build
```

## Run
The container will be run inside the openwhisk [docker-compose][2] environment

```bash
make run
```

This command would starts the user-events service along with [Prometheus][4] and Grafana[5]

These ports must be available:

- `9095` - user-events service
- `9096` - prometheus
- `3000` - Grafana

## Logs

- `docker-compose` logs - `~/tmp/openwhisk/docker-compose-events.log`

Integrations
------------

#### Prometheus
The docker container would run the service and expose the metrics in format required by Prometheus at `9095` port
